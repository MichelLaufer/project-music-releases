# Building a 'New Releases' music site using React

The ninth week's project in the Technigo bootcamp was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.
Technigo downloaded a response from the Spotify API which we used along with `.map()` to mount an 'Album' component for each album.

I split the project up into components and used .map to iterature over an array of data with album-objects. I also added a sidebar-component in which the user could choose between a number of playlists.
