# Build a 'New Releases' music site using React

This week's project in the Technigo boot camp was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

Since the focus of this assignment was to practice with React, Technigo downloaded a response from the Spotify API which we could use, rather than calling the API by ourselves. Our task was to use this, along with `.map()` to mount an 'Album' component for each album.
